Context API is used on this project. It provides a global state to the app. It is a simple way to manage the state of the app.

### Clean code 💅🏻

I've added Husky + Lint-staged flow, in order to keep safe our code. They check errors on pre-commit and pre-push events.


Also, I've added too ESLint rules that order correctly the imports lines by group and order alphabetically props components.
## Deploy 📦

I've decided to use Github pagess because it has a simple Installation and Configuration flow. Netlify allows us that on every commit into `main` a new deploy runs upgrading the Site page. Also it provides us Preview Deploys, like the followings:
